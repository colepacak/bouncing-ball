# Bouncing Ball
### AngularJS directive

This is the component your site has been waiting for: a stand-alone AngularJS directive where the user can set the dimensions of a field and add balls to it that bounce. I know.
Perfect for boring sites where you're trying to keep users from navigating away too quickly.

In all seriousness, my goals here were to:

1. Write an isolate scope directive that could operate freely from its controller (keeping DOM manipulation exclusively in the directive).
2. Experiment with a prototypal approach to working with objects.

Feedback and questions are totally welcome.
